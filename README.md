# Coca-cola Fans Network Infusion Study

By investigating the social influence of people's beverage choice, we can then come back to focus on the Pepsi and Coca-Cola issues more accurately. So to break down our research, we are doing a digging process to tackle the following questions: 
If drinking carbonated beverages or not will separate people into two groups, the relationship with each group will be closer. If so, what are the similarities and differences between the two groups?
If drinking carbonated beverages is infectious by peer-to-peer influence, in other words, are you more likely to start drinking coke if your friend drinks coke youâ€™re more likely to start drinking coke.  
If carbonated beverage drinking turns out to be impacted by peer-to-peer influence, do different brands show different patterns? Or if different brands link up different groups of people who seem to be loyal to that brand? And what are the similarities and differences between the brand's fans group?
